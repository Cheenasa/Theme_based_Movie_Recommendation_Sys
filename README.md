# Theme_based_Movie_Recommendation_Sys
This project proposes a Theme-Based Movie Recommendation System that leverages NLP techniques to analyze movie plot summaries, extract themes, extract emotions, and recommend similar movies based on narrative characteristics. The system is designed to provide a richer, plot-driven discovery experience tailored to each viewerâ€™s preferences.
